# Hardware Description  

## Overview  

AmebaPro2 board is an easy-to-program platform for developing all kind of IoT applications. AmebaPro2 is equipped with various peripheral interfaces, including WiFi, BLE, GPIO INT, I2C, UART, SPI, PWM, and ADC. Through these interfaces, AmebaPro2 can connect with electronic components such as LED, switches, manometer, hygrometer, PM2.5 dust sensors …etc. Besides, AmebaPro2 has three key features: Audio codec, Video codec and NN (build in NPU for AIoT).
